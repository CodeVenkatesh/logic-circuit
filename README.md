# LogicCircuit
A Python module to simulate logical circuits/graphs.

Inspired by the computational graph behind TensorFlow. Granted, it might be overkill but it *is* very powerful.

The module builds a graph as variables are created. Then, the graph can be evaluated to obtain an output. Example code will become availiable once devlopment reaches some presentable point.
